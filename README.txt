Intro to language:

This language is statically typed. No casting is allowed. This means, programmers must code for the exact situations and functions they need. While this can make coding difficult, because for more complex programs you have potential for more type errors, it will also make learning the language very easy. SimpleCode can handle basic mathematical operations, logical statements, and displaying of simple outputs to the user. Keywords in this language are not case specific, and while this limits the number of keywords our language can have, the requirements of our language are such that a few keywords will be suffice. Variable names in this language are also not case sensitive. This makes checking for case unnecessary which is nice for the programmer. Variable names can be anything regardless of data type.

Keywords (case non-specific): 
print
say
when
if
during

Booleans:
during (while)
when (for)
if
boolean (True/False)
<
>
<=
>=

Operators:
*
/
+
-
=
(
)


The language utilizes few keywords which keeps things simple and straight forward. Obviously, this language isn’t intended for complex problems, but solving basic types of mathematical and logical problems should be able to be accommodated by SimpleCode. 

Data Types: 

The following data types are allowed in SimpleCode: 

Num – This data type is a real number data type. This language has no data type for integers because all integers belong to the category of real numbers. This will keep things simple for the programmer because the consideration of what number type will not need to be made. 

Say – This data type is for all representations of strings or characters. When using the keyword “say”,  it should be followed by a user defined variable name,  followed by any text surround by double quotation marks.

ex. 

say name “My name is Anon”


This syntax keeps things simple and very close to natural language. It is intuitive and makes sense to new users.


Operators:

The following operators are allowed in SimpleCode: *, /, +, -, =

These operators will allow the programmer to tackle numerous basic math functions. 

Literals:
var 
string
